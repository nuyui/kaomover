     ( o.o )   kao is ready to organize your mods :3
     > 📂 <

hi everyone! thank you so much for stopping by to meet kao, your adorable little helper for sims 4 mods! he is very, very happi :3  

σ(￣、￣〃) - totally not happy and embarrassed hehe  

kao and i got tired of seeing all of our .package files scattered everywhere (￢_￢). sorting mods by hand is boring, and honestly… a bit unfair to kao, and even me. it was a pain in the ass. so now, kao hops in to automatically move your sims 4 cc and scripts into the right folder, saving you time and a lot of headaches. ヽ(♡‿♡)ノ  

i looked around and didn’t find anyone else making a tool like this, so i decided to make one myself! (╬ ò﹏ó)  

since i already know a bit of scripting, me and kao made a quick script that automatically moves your sims 4 mods into the right folder. now i’m sharing it so you can have a smoother experience with your sims 4 cc too.  

if you don’t want to download a .bat file directly, that’s totally fine! me and kao understand (ノ_<。). okay maybe he doesn’t… just follow the manual installation instructions below!!

## updates
08.26.25 – kao got even more helpful!! he can also move .ts4script files straight into your mods folder too :)  

---

## installation (simple)
- download the .bat file from here
- download your favorite cc or mods (make sure .package files are in your downloads folder).  
- run the script.  
- watch kao put your files into place 🐾  
- done ヽ(￣ω￣(。。 )ゝ  
- enjoy your organized sims 4 mods folder 

---

## manual installation (a bit trickier)
- download the github text file named `script.txt`.  
- open it and replace the placeholder text with your windows username.  
- (optional) if your .package files are stored somewhere other than downloads, replace `downloads` with that path.  
- (optional) if you want the files moved to a specific subfolder, add `\folder_name` to the destination path.  
- make sure all folders exist—kao can’t put files into unknown places!  

pssssst… for silly people like me and kao who prefer watching instead of reading, don’t worry! i’ll make a video tutorial soon 🐾
