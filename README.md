     ( o.o )   kao is ready to organize your mods :3
     > 📁 <

hi everyone! thank you so much for stopping by to meet kao, your adorable little helper for sims 4 mods! he is very, very happi :3  

σ(￣、￣〃) - totally not happy and embarrassed hehe  

kao and i got tired of seeing all of our .package files scattered everywhere (￢_￢). sorting mods by hand is boring, and honestly… a bit unfair to kao, and even me. it was a pain in the ass. so now, kao hops in to automatically move your sims 4 cc and scripts into the right folder, saving you time and a lot of headaches. ヽ(♡‿♡)ノ  

i looked around and didn’t find anyone else making a tool like this, so i decided to make one myself! (╬ ò﹏ó)  

since i already know a bit of scripting, me and kao made a quick script that automatically moves your sims 4 mods into the right folder. now i’m sharing it so you can have a smoother experience with your sims 4 cc too.  

if you don’t want to download a .bat file directly, that’s totally fine! me and kao understand (ノ_<。). okay maybe he doesn’t… just follow the manual installation instructions below!!

## what is kao-mover ? 🐾

kao-mover is a tiny helper for your Sims 4 mods & cc !! instead of sorting through all your .package files one by one, kao swoops in and moves them into the right folders for you. it's very simple: choose where your files live, pick where you want them to go, and kao does the rest :3 !! even giving you a log (optional) if you want to see exactly what moved.

made with love and patience, kao-mover is perfect for anyone tired of manually organizing their sims 4 cc and mods. just run the script, watch kao do the work, and enjoy your tidy mods folder !!

if there are any bugs or issues with the script, please be kind and let me know !!

## [installation (simple)](https://youtu.be/E2d5jZJVNYk)
- download the .bat file from here
- download your favorite cc or mods (make sure .package files are in your downloads folder).  
- run the script.  
- watch kao put your files into place 🐾  
- done ヽ(￣ω￣(。。 )ゝ  
- enjoy your organized sims 4 mods folder

## [manual installation (a bit trickier)](https://youtu.be/Hy8G4N-qDXI)
- download the github text file named `script.txt`.  
- open it and replace the placeholder text with your windows username.  
- (optional) if your .package files are stored somewhere other than downloads, replace `downloads` with that path.  
- (optional) if you want the files moved to a specific subfolder, add `\folder_name` to the destination path.  
- make sure all folders exist—kao can’t put files into unknown places!  

~~pssssst… for silly people like me and kao who prefer watching instead of reading, don’t worry! i’ll make a video tutorial soon 🐾~~

## tos/tou 

- this script and all its code are completely owned by me. please don’t claim it as your own. 
- kao-mover is made for your personal Sims 4 mods organization. commercial use is not allowed.
- while kao tries his best, i'm not responsible if something goes wrong. back up your files before using!
- dont re-upload the script elsewhere claiming it’s yours.

thank you for respecting my work and letting kao help you organize your mods !!
